# boostingtechniques
In this i have performed two basic boosting method.

# An ensemble technique, in the context of machine learning, is a methodology that combines multiple individual models (often referred to as "base models" or "weak learners") to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. The fundamental idea behind ensemble techniques is that by aggregating the predictions of multiple models, you can often achieve better overall performance than what any individual model can achieve on its own.

Ensemble techniques are commonly used in machine learning for several reasons:

### Improved Predictive Accuracy: 
By combining the strengths of multiple models and mitigating their weaknesses, ensemble methods can lead to more accurate and robust predictions. They are especially effective when individual models have complementary areas of expertise or exhibit diversity in their errors.

### Reduced Overfitting: 
Ensemble methods can help reduce overfitting, a common problem in machine learning, by averaging out the noise and capturing the underlying patterns more effectively.

### Model Stability: 
Ensembles are often more stable and less sensitive to changes in the dataset or hyperparameters compared to individual models.

# There are various types of ensemble techniques, including:

# Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): In bagging, multiple copies of the same base model are trained on different subsets of the training data with replacement. These models' predictions are then combined, typically by averaging, to produce the final prediction. Random Forest is a well-known ensemble method based on bagging.

# Boosting: Boosting aims to create an ensemble of models sequentially, where each subsequent model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. Common algorithms for boosting include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

# Voting: In this approach, multiple models are trained independently, and the final prediction is determined by a majority vote (for classification tasks) or an average (for regression tasks) of the individual models' predictions. This is often referred to as "hard voting" for classification and "soft voting" for regression.

# Stacking: Stacking involves training multiple base models and then training a meta-model (often called a "blender" or "meta-learner") that takes the predictions of the base models as input and produces the final prediction. Stacking can be more complex but often yields superior results.

# Ensemble techniques are widely used in real-world applications and competitions, such as Kaggle, because they frequently lead to top-performing models. The choice of which ensemble method to use depends on the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the nature of the base models being employed.

In this, we performed two different kinds of bossting techniques.
### AdaBoosting
### Gradient Boosting
